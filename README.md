The app was developed using Flutter and implements ggerganov/llama.cpp, recompiled to work on mobiles. Please note that Meta officially distributes the LLaMA models, and they will not be provided by the app developers.

To run this app, you need to download the 7B llama model from Meta for research purposes. You can choose the target model (should be a xxx.bin) from the app.

Additionally, you can fine-tune the ouput with preprompts to improve its performance.
